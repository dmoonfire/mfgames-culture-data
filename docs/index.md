MfGames Culture Data
====================

Files
-----

Data files are JSON formatted data in the appropiate format. The name of the file is the [source](sources.md) as a directory structure. This is typically lowercase, but may include capitals for IEFT language tags.

* `./nonfiction/en-US.json`
* `./nonfiction/gregorian.json`

The `id` attribute in the file must match its dirctory structure, minus the `./` and the `.json` extension. For example, `nonfiction/en-US` or `nonfiction/gregorian`.
